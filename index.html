      <div class="aboutklop">
          <p><span class="Thetrainer">-- The trainer --</span> Jürgen Norbert Klopp
            (German pronunciation: born 16 June 1967)
            is a German professional football manager and former player who
            is the manager of
            Premier League club Liverpool. He is widely regarded as one of the
             best managers in the world.[citation needed]
Klopp spent most of his playing career at Mainz 05. He was initially deployed as a
striker, but was later moved to defence. Upon retiring in 2001, Klopp became the club's
manager, and secured Bundesliga promotion in 2004. After suffering relegation in the 2006–07 seas
on and unable to achieve promotion, Klopp resigned in 2008 as the club's longest-serving manager.
He then became manager of Borussia Dortmund, guiding them to the Bundesliga title in 2010–11, before wi
nning Dortmund's first-ever domestic double during a record-breaking season.[note 1] Klopp also guided Dortmund to
 a runner-up finish in the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League before leaving in 2015 as their longest-serving manager.</p>

        <p><span class="rightwing">--Right wing--</span>Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly (Arabic:
           محمد صلاح حامد محروس غال], born 15 June
          1992) is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League
          club Liverpool and captains the Egypt national team. Considered one of the best players in
           the world,[6][7] he is known for his finishing, dribbling, and speed.

Salah started his senior career in 2010 playing for Al Mokawloon, departing in 2012 to jo
in Basel, where he won two Swiss Super League titles. In 2014, Salah joined Chelsea for a
 reported fee of £11 million, but limited gametime led to successive loans to Fiorentina and Ro
 ma, who later signed him permanently for €15 million. In 2017, Salah was the subject of
 a then-club record association football transfer when he signed for Liverpool for £36.9 million,
  becoming the most expensive Egyptian player of all time. There, Salah won the Premier League, the
   UEFA Champions League, the League Cup, the Premier League Golden Boot twice, and finished third for
    the Best FIFA Men's Player in 2018 and 2021. He also holds the record for most Premier League goals
     scored (32) in a 38-game season, and ranks as Liverpool's ninth-highest all-time top goalscorer</p>

After starting his career with Figueirense in 2009, he spent four-and-a-half seasons at Hoffenheim.
His 16 goals in 33 games for the 2013–14 Bundesliga season earned him the award for the league's
Breakthrough Player. In July 2015, he signed for Liverpool. His creativity, goalscoring and work
 rate have earned him plaudits at Liverpool, with manager Jürgen Klopp referring to Firmino as the
 "engine" that propels the club's counter-attacking system.[5] In the 2018–19 season he won the UEFA
 Champions League, and the following season won the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Club World Cup after scoring
 the winner in the final, and the 2019–20 Premier League title, Liverpool's first league title in 30 years.
